# RStudio Shiny Support

RCloud is 100% compatible with the [RStudio Shiny web application framework](http://shiny.rstudio.com) via the rcloud.shiny package. `rcloud.shiny` emulates a network connection to run Shiny on an RCloud server and client instead of a Shiny server.

Although comprehensive documentation of rcloud.shiny is beyond the scope of this document, the implementation is simple enough to get many users already familiar with Shiny started.

```
# Include rcloud.shiny library
library(rcloud.shiny)
# Include all the libraries from ui.R and server.R
library(datasets)

# The rcloud.shinyApp function is the equivalent of the shinyApp
# (http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_embedded_shiny.html#inline-applications)
# function in shiny library.
rcloud.shinyApp(
            
	# Pass the ui.R code something as shown below. 
  ui = fluidPage(

  	# Application title
    headerPanel("Word Cloud"),
    .
    .
    .
    etc.
```
