shared.R URLs
=============

Files can be served from user R libraries via
`shared.R/<user>/<package>`. Users can develop packages that use
shared.R in their own development library until it is ready to be
released.

Note that users are still responsible for setting the permissions on the
library path -- default permissions deny access, including the web
server, to user libraries.
