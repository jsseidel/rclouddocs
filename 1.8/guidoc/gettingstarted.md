# Getting Started

RCloud supports Chrome, Chromium (the open-source version of Chrome) and Firefox web browsers; download the latest version of any of these to get started.

In order to implement version control in the background, or in other words, in order for RCloud to store information about users and their RCloud notebooks, RCloud uses GitHub technology. Therefore, a new user must register with their installation's instance of GitHub or login or create a public GitHub account; please refer to your installation's local documentation about creating a new GitHub user or see our Tutorial ['Anonymous User versus Data Scientist Access'](https:/rcloud.social/tutorials/) for information about creating an RCloud and GitHub account on the public instance.

Since every installation's networking architecture will be different, please refer to your installation's local documentation for any relevant environment information.
