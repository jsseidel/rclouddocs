# Getting Started

RCloud supports Chrome, Chromium (the open-source version of Chrome), and Firefox web browsers. Download the latest version of any of these to get started.

RCloud stores information about users and their RCloud notebooks using GitHub technology. Therefore, new users must either register with their installation's instance of GitHub or create a public GitHub account. Please refer to your installation's documentation about creating a new GitHub user or see our Tutorial, [Anonymous User versus Data Scientist Access](https:/rcloud.social/tutorials/), for information about creating an RCloud/GitHub account on the public RCloud instance.

Since every installation's networking architecture will be different, please refer to your installation's documentation for any relevant environment information.
