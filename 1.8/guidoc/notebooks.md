# Notebooks

RCloud notebooks are simply collections of prompt and Markdown cells, comments, and assets, which we'll get to later. Everything in your public notebooks is searchable by every other user of the system. This encourages reuse and makes learning how to use the hundreds of available R packages somewhat easier.

You can also browse everyone else's notebooks by opening the Notebooks section on the left sidebar. To do this, simply click on Notebooks at the top of the panel. This toggles the panel, opening or closing it:

![RCloud User / Notebook Directory](img/notebooks.png)

To load a notebook into the current session, click on the name. After it loads, you can examine the source code or click "Run" in the header bar to execute all the cells on the page.



## Creating a notebook

To create a new, blank notebook, click the + sign at the right of the Notebooks panel header area:

![New Notebook Creation Icon](img/newnotebook.png)

RCloud will automatically choose a title for your new notebook, Notebook N, where N is the next available number among your notebooks. To give your notebook a more meaningful title, click on the [title in the header bar](headerbar.html#header-bar).

To change the default name of new notebooks, see the [New Notebook Prefixes](settings.html#new-notebook-prefixes) sub-section in the Settings panel.



## Running a notebook

To run all the cells in your notebook, click the ![Header Bar: Play Icon](img/header_play.png) icon in the header bar.

RCloud notebooks are executed asynchronously. RCloud will show individual cell results as the results are ready to display.

To run only selected cells, hold down the `Ctrl/Cmd` key when you click the ![Header Bar: Play Icon](img/header_play.png) icon in the header bar. See the [Multi-Cell Selection](#multi-cell-selection) section for more information about multiple-cell selection.

### Partial notebook runs

Pressing the ![Markdown Cell Play Icon](img/runmarkdown.png) icon in a cell while holding down the `Shift` key will run that cell and every cell after in order.



## Long-running notebooks

Notebooks that run longer than a few seconds will cause the browser screen to dim and a please-wait message to be displayed.

Currently, RCloud has no explicit mechanism to stop a long-running notebook. If you mistakenly launch a long-running notebook, you can simply reload the notebook in another browser tab or reload the page.  This doesn't stop the execution behind the scenes, but the output of the previous run will not interrupt your current session. Be careful of side-effects, like changing the contents of a file in your local directory in such a way that it affects the output of the notebook.



## Forking (copying) a notebook

To copy another user's notebook, first navigate to it using the left sidebar and then click to load it into your current session. Now, you're running another user's public notebook in your own session. This is sufficient for running reports or performing other read-only activities.  If you want to edit the notebook, you'll need to make your own copy, or, "fork" it.

After you've loaded the notebook you want to fork, click the Fork icon in the header bar at the top of the screen:

![Fork Icon](img/fork.png)

After forking a notebook, you'll own your own copy and be able to edit it.

The fork icon is always available, which means you can fork your own notebooks. If you are viewing a previous version of a notebook, you can fork a copy of that version. Caution: currently when you fork your own notebook, the history is lost; we hope to fix this soon.



## Saving your work

There are two mechanisms by which your work is saved in RCloud.

### Manual Saving

You can save your notebook at any time by clicking the ![Header Bar: Save Icon](img/header_save.png) icon in the header bar.



### Versioning

RCloud keeps track of your notebook versions automatically and frequently. Every time you save, create, or run a Markdown or Prompt cell, the newest version of your notebook is saved. To browse different versions of your notebook, which are stored chronologically with the latest version on top, hover over the name of your notebook in the left sidebar and click the clock icon. A drop-down list of versions will appear:

![Notebook History / Version Icon](img/notebookhistory.png)

To change they way dates and times are displayed next to your notebook versions, see the [show terse version dates](settings.html#show-terse-version-dates) setting.



#### Version Tagging

To tag a notebook version, click twice on a version name to edit it in place.

![Version Tagging](img/version_tag.png)

Now, rather than referring to a specific notebook version with `&version=hash` in a URL, you can refer to a specific notebook tag:

![Version Tagging URL](img/url_tag.png)

`&tag=name`

This is useful when you want to share a version of a notebook but plan to continue developing it. For example, you can tag a version as the "LatestProductionVersion," and then apply that tag to another version when you're ready to share your new work. This way, existing URLs (perhaps stored in someone's bookmarks) won't break as you update your notebooks.



#### Reverting to a previous version

Should you decide that a previous version of your notebook is the "best" version, you can make that version the current version by first loading the desired previous version of the notebook and then clicking the revert icon.

![Revert Icon](img/revert.png)



## Hidden notebooks

By default, all RCloud notebooks are visible to all RCloud users. If you'd like to toggle the Show/Hide flag on a notebook, hover over the name of your notebook on the left sidebar and click the eye icon. Note that hidden notebook titles are grayed out for owners and invisible to other users.

Hidden notebooks are only invisible within the RCloud interface. Hidden notebooks are still visible within the gists stored in your GitHub instance.



### Toggle hidden

Clicking the ![Private Notebook Icon Toggle](img/privatenotebook.png) icon will hide your notebook from other RCloud users.



### Toggle show

Clicking the ![Public Notebook Icon Toggle](img/publicnotebook.png) icon will make your notebook readable by other RCloud users.



## Protecting your notebooks

Protected notebooks are readable only by the owner and (optionally) a select group of users and will not show up in search results (although previously unprotected versions might).

### Notebook permissions

View or modify notebook protection by clicking the notebook "info" button next to the notebook name in the notebooks tree:

![Notebook Information Icon](img/notebookinfo.png)

If you own the notebook, click the "public" link (or "no group" if that displays):

![Protection Dialog Box; No Group](img/nogroup.png)

This opens the notebook protection dialog:

![Protection Dialog Box: Permissions](img/notebookperms.png)

Here, you can assign the notebook to any group you are a member of, make it entirely private (readable only by you), or make it public (readable by anyone).

### Groups

Use the second tab of the protection dialog to create/rename groups and/or assign other users as administrators/members of groups you administrate. Alternatively, you can select Manage Groups from the Advanced menu item on [the header bar](headerbar.html#header-bar) â€” note that the Notebook tab will be grayed out in that case, as Manage Groups is not notebook specific.

![Protection Dialog Box: Group Information](img/groupman.png)

Unlike a hidden notebook, protected notebooks are not readable by anyone without permission, even within your GitHub instance.



## Deleting Notebooks

To delete a notebook, hover over the name of your notebook in the left sidebar and click the ![Delete Notebook Icon](img/deletenotebook.png) icon.

RCloud will ask for a confirmation:

![Confirm Notebook Deletion Dialog Box](img/confirm_delete.png)

Click OK. The notebook will disappear from the left sidebar. The last-viewed available notebook will automatically load into the current session.



## Sharing your notebooks

There are several ways you can share/view your notebooks. When you click on the downward arrow next to the share icon in the header bar ![Header Bar: Share Icon](img/header_share.png), a popup menu will appear:

![Header Bar: Notebook Share Type / View Mode](img/header_sharetype.png)

Here, you select the kind of URL you'd like to share. Make your selection using the popup menu and then right click on the ![Header Bar: Share Icon](img/header_share.png) icon to copy the hyperlink.

Clicking on a selection in the sharing menu will open a new browser tab and load the selected link.

Note that if you have a tagged version of your notebook currently loaded, where appropriate, RCloud will populate the shared URL with the tag instead of the version. This is beneficial because then you can tag future versions with the same tag and not break existing URLs.



### `view.html`

This is the simplest method. This will create a link that will allow someone to see the notebook code and execute the notebook within the RCloud IDE. Users who do not own the notebook will see the play ![Header Bar: Play Icon](img/header_play.png) and share ![Header Bar: Edit Icon](img/header_edit.png) icons in the header. Clicking the play icon will execute all cells in the notebook. Clicking the edit icon will return to the normal header, allowing a user to fork the notebook, etc.

#### Hiding UI Elements

To hide *all* UI elements, add `&quiet=1` to the URL. Note that this works only with `view.html`.



### `viewiip.html`

View the notebook as a Slidy Powerpoint-like slideshow. (TBD: more information needed)



### `flexdashboard.html`

View a notebook that uses the flexdashboard package. (TBD: more information needed)



### `notebook.R`

This option is intended for [FastRweb](http://rforge.net/FastRWeb/) notebooks. Loading the URL (from anywhere, including other notebooks, a perl script, etc.) executes a notebook "behind the scenes" by opening a one-time R session, running the defined "function" within, shutting down the R session, and finally, returning the result. FastRweb notebooks MUST have a function named `function()` defined, as this is what notebook.R tries to execute upon instantiation. Output from `notebook.R` can be anything (e.g. text, binary data). This information will ultimately be processed by whatever mechanism called `notebook.R`.

`notebook.R` allows trailing paths to be processed by the notebook code if they start with `/.self/`. The subsequent path portion is passed to the run function as the `.path.info` argument. This allows notebooks to handle a "full tree" argument to the notebook on top of a single notebook URL.

E.g.: `https://rcloud.mydomain.com/notebook.R/user/notebook/.self/foo/bar` will call the notebook with `.path.info` set to `/foo/bar`. Note that the `.self` part distinguishes asset look up from a path info call.

See the [notebook.R URLs](notebookurls.html#notebook-r-urls) section of the documentation for more detailed information about `notebook.R` URLs.



### `mini.html`

Unlike `notebook.R`, `mini.html` URLs open an R session via a Websocket and keeps it open. `mini.html` notebooks must have a function named `rcw.result()` defined, as that is what `mini.html` tries to execute upon instantiation. Because the R session is kept open, users or processes can interact with the R session while the websocket is open.



### `shiny.html`

RCloud supports the [RStudio Shiny web application framework](http://shiny.rstudio.com/). To share [Shiny-enabled notebooks](rstudioshinysupport.html#rstudio-shiny-support), select this option.



## Who starred my notebook?

To find out which users starred your notebook, click the notebook information icon:

![Notebook Information Icon](img/notebookinfo.png)



## Multi-cell selection

You can use RCloud's multi-cell selection features to perform various actions on many cells at once.

![Multi-cell Feature](img/multicell.png)

* At the top of your loaded notebook, you'll find a header bar. Click the checkbox to select/deselect every cell in your notebook.
* Click a cell's header to select that cell. Note that clicking the header of a selected cell does not deselect the cell.
* Click a cell's checkbox to select/deselect that cell.
* Click the ![output](img/cellheader_output.png) icon to hide the output of selected cells. Note that this feature is only available with your own notebooks.
* Click the ![crop](img/cellheader_crop.png) icon to remove every cell that isn't selected.
* Click the ![trash](img/cellheader_delete.png) icon to delete all selected cells. Note that RCloud will indicate how many cells are selected out of the total number of cells.

Use the checkbox dropdown menu to fine-tune your selection:

![Multi-call Feature Dropdown Menu](img/checkdropdown.png)

* **All** selects every cell in your notebook.
* **None** deselects every cell in your notebook.
* **Invert** changes every selected cell to an deselected cell and every deselected cell to a selected cell.

Multi-cell selection supports common keyboard extensions:

* **Shift-clicking** a cell's checkbox will select all cells between the last selected checkbox and the current checkbox.
* **Ctrl/command-clicking** a cell's checkbox is functionaly equivalent to checking a cell's checkbox and is noted here because it is a common selection activity.
* Pressing the **delete key** will delete all selected cells.
* **Ctrl/command-k** will crop (remove) all unselected cells.
* **Ctrl/command-Shift-i** will invert the selection (select deselected cells and deselect selected cells)



## Find and find replace

To find text within your notebook, type `Ctrl-F` (Win/Linux) or `Cmd-F` (Mac) to open a find dialog at the top of your notebook:

![Find Text Dialog](img/find.png)

To find and replace text within your notebook, type `Ctrl-H` (Win/Linux) or `Cmd-Option-F` (Mac) to open a find and replace dialog at the top of your notebook:

![Find and Replace Text Dialog](img/find_replace.png)



## Recent Notebooks

Access your recently opened notebooks via the Recent link in the Notebooks titlebar:
