# rclouddocs

I have contributed GUI documentation to the [RCloud](http://rcloud.social) project for several years. This repository is a staging area for the official GUI documentation. I used a soon-to-be-open-sourced documentation system of my own design to build the GUI documentation.

This is a work in progress currently.
