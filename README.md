# rclouddocs

I have contributed GUI documentation to the [RCloud](http://rcloud.social) project for several years. This repository is a staging area for the official GUI documentation. I use [MkTechDocs](https://github.com/att/mktechdocs) to build the GUI documentation.

This is a work in progress currently.
